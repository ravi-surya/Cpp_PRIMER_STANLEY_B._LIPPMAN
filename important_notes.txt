------we can have an 'istream' as a condition in a while loop, the 
  istream is valid if the 'stream' has not encountered any problem or error then 
  the test succeeds.
  if the stream encounters an error like the value is INVALID or if we hit end-of-file,
  then the while loop terminates.

  ex:   #include <iostream>
        int main()
        {
            int sum = 0, value = 0;
            // read until end-of-file, calculating a running total of all values read
            while (std::cin >> value)
                /*std::cin >> value
                That expression reads the next number from the standard input and stores that
                number in value. The input operator >> returns its left operand, which
                in this case is std::cin. This condition, therefore, tests std::cin
                */
                sum += value; // equivalent to sum = sum + value
            std::cout << "Sum is: " << sum << std::endl;
            return 0;
        } 


------in windows the 'end-of-file' is 'ctrl + z'
