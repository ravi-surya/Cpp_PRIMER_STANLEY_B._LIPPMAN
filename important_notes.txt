------we can have an 'istream' as a condition in a while loop, the 
  istream is valid if the 'stream' has not encountered any problem or error then 
  the test succeeds.
  if the stream encounters an error like the value is INVALID or if we hit end-of-file,
  then the while loop terminates.

  ex:   #include <iostream>
        int main()
        {
            int sum = 0, value = 0;
            // read until end-of-file, calculating a running total of all values read
            while (std::cin >> value)
                /*std::cin >> value
                That expression reads the next number from the standard input and stores that
                number in value. The input operator >> returns its left operand, which
                in this case is std::cin. This condition, therefore, tests std::cin
                */
                sum += value; // equivalent to sum = sum + value
            std::cout << "Sum is: " << sum << std::endl;
            return 0;
        } 


------in windows the 'end-of-file' is 'ctrl + z'

------ edit-compile-debug  - good technique

------in c++ we define a data structure by defining a class. class defines A TYPE along with A
        collection of operations that are related to that TYPE.

------ to use a class we need to know three things:
        -what is its name?
        -where is it definied?
        -what operations does it support?

------ member functions or methods are functions defined in a class and is accessed by an 
        object of that class, by a DOT "." operator.
        TO CALL A MEMBER FUNCTION BY THE DOT OPERATOR WE USE () brackets 
        ex: item.isbn() to call the function isbn() we use () brackets, THAT MAY 
        OR MAY NOT HAVE ARGUEMENTS.
        **

------ Types are fundamental to any program :They tell us what our data mean and what operations
        we can perform on those data
